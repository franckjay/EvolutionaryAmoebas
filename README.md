Evolutionary Algorithm learning weights in order to play Space Invaders with OpenAI's Gym environment.

Included are three separate codes that will use slightly different, self-explanatory architectures to learn. 
Anecdotally, the population size is not incredibly important above 10 and below 100. Keep sigma near where it is. LR could use some optimization.
